# Chrome Extension Icon Generator

This is a simple tool to generate icons for Chrome extensions. It takes any image above 128x128px and generates all the sizes needed for Chrome extensions.

It will create a 16px, 32px, 48px and 128px icon from the image you upload.

It will then give you the code to add to your manifest.json file.

"icons": {
"16": "icon16.png",
"32": "icon32.png",
"48": "icon48.png",
"128": "icon128.png"
},
